Happy to Finally be at the end of the journey. My react project came out pretty good. I had my reservations at first but, soon I got a hang of the components, props, state structure of react. It keeps the code modular and clean. And it also adheres to the separation of concerns and, single responsibility model.  I had a blad throughout this project. The lead instructors Howard and Enocj were a wealth of knowledge. I incorporated Redux store which was a bit of a challenge but, I finally got it. I was able to effortlessly incorporate the routs and, redux thunk. Although i felt thunk was not needed. Being proficient with JS really helped.
