Object-Oriented Programming  bundles customized functions that can be performed on that data. These are called methods: behaviors that an object performs upon its internal data and even upon other code objects.  An object in code is a thing with all the data and all the logic required to complete a task. Objects are models and metaphors for the problems we solve in code.  Object-oriented programming was born from the trend of making digital lives reflect our real lives.

Ruby comes with a few types of Objects to get us started, things like Integer, String, Array, etc. We call these base types of Objects "Primitives." But what if we wanted to create a new type in our programming universe, a new kind of object for our code? That's what the class keyword and object orientation allows us to do.

Objects are metaphors for real life concepts. We instantiate or create objects through classes. We define classes with the class Keyword. We instantiate an intance of the class with the class constructor new. Below are some of the key concepts of OO Ruby. 

1. Instantiate instances of the class with the class constructor new.
2. Add attributes to our instances with setter/getter methods and instance variables
3. Use the attr_accessor, attr_reader and attr_writer methods to dynamically create setter and getter methods
4. Keep track of all our class' instances with class variables and class methods
5. Hook into an object's instantiation with #initialize
6. Use implicit and, explicit receivers
7. Define a class find_by_name method to find specific instances
