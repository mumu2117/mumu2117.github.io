I finished my Rails project early and, was the first to finish in my cohort.  COVID-19 took my focus off before I could finish my blog and, video and submit it. Going to store one day and seeing all the aisles empty hit me hard. I started following the crowd and, collecting supplies before things get worse. Hopefully this is just going to be like y2k where a big deal was made out of nothing. Finally found most of my stuff and, decided to get the blog and, video completed and, submit the project and, schedule a review.

had already had an idea for an app in my head based on my own personal experiences. I was going to create an app where you can keep a list of all the TV shows you are watching. With this in mind, I decided to go through the lessons, Avi's videos and, some of the videos on learn instruction link to go complete my project. 

The hardest part was the associations. I had to read the nested routes quite a bit to get a hang of it. It was complicated at first. The rake routes command that lists the rout helpers was a HUGE help. Using Grep I could narrow it down to what I wanted to see.  How to get a user-submittable attribute on one of the join models, was the hardest part of my project.

After several struggles during the Sinatra review week I came up with the following: 

A User model, Watchlist model, and Show model would all be connected through a joins model, which represents a userâ€™s unique relationship with one show.

With the basic structure in place, I began building out the models, then controllers and views.

Validations were a HUGE coding savior. Now, I did not have to code as much as my Sinatra or my CLI projects to try to validate an object. Whew! 
I set some basic validations on most of my models, and had a little bit more fun creating a custom validation.  

Once I had set up my models and relationships, building out the views, controllers and forms was a breeze. This was an area that I felt very knowledgeable of from continued practice in the Rails section. When I ran into problems or needed to think of a clever way to build out a form or get something through a controller, the Rails guide, Stack Overflow, and Google were a huge help.
