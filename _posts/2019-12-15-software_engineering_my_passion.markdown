#Stumbled Upon My Passion

I started dabling into various divisions of IT when I wanted to pursue a career in IT. I started with COMPTIA certifications. Having secured both Security+ and, Network+ my next step was to secure CEH. As I started studying for the certificaiton I realized I need to learn SQL, some javascript, ruby, html  etc in order to understand the cybersecurity tools that dealt with secure coding, sql injections etc. I went on to w3schools.com to dabble in programming and started actully enjoying it. I realized all my fears of programming are just that "Fears."  As i started praticing more with courses on Udemy, I realized I need to join a software engineering school in order to put my skills to the test.  And here I am. I picked Flatiron school becuase  of their phenomenal resources that helped me learn and, get prepped up before the class. 

Of course I faced some obstacles. Having two senior dogs with ailments I did not want to abandon my companions in the times of their need and, go to a class everyday leaving them at home all alone. Especially since, the full time classes were from 9-6 pm with commute that would leave me rushing in and out.  Thanks to the online program I am able to give the care my senior dogs need as well as accomplish my goals of being a software engineer. Being a girl I was never able to get the best of education or personal encouragement in my birth country (india.)  I always wanted to be a software engineer but, was never given the opportunity or encouragement to do so.  I am elated to be accepted into flatiron school and, to be givne this opportunity to make  my dreams come true.  I hope I can succeed and, help others succeed as well.
